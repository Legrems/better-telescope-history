# Add this to your ~/.zshrc if 'make' command has issues
#
# Some zsh configurations have a 'make' function that interferes with the make command
# This alias ensures you use the actual make binary

alias make='/usr/bin/make'

# Alternatively, you can add this to your ~/.zshrc:
# unfunction make 2>/dev/null
